description: Maurya's son Michael has been swept out to the sea, the latest of the
  men in her household to die. While they wait for his body to wash ashore, the last
  remaining man in the house, Bartley, decides to take a boat to the mainland for
  the Connemara horse fair. But Maurya's premonition of the ghost of Michael following
  Bartley out to sea proves ominous, leaving Maurya and her daughters alone. First
  performed in 1904, Synge's one-act play 'Riders to the Sea' carries with it the
  weight of a culture in thrall to the ocean around it, in a style reminiscent of
  ancient Greek tragedy,at once unmistakably local and inescapably epic.
